# my-econometrics-notebook

A personal repository documenting my journey through econometrics using Python.  
This repository uses the **Wages dataset** from the `wooldridge` package to explore various econometric concepts.

This notebook is designed to simplify econometrics for anyone engaging with the subject â€” whether you're a student, researcher, or professional. I've focused on highlighting only the most essential concepts and techniques â€” not too much, not too little â€” just the core ideas that matter. It's meant to be straightforward, easy to understand, and equally useful as a personal reference for me to revisit and brush up when needed.
